## Description
Triton is an example project creating a rest api with express js and typeorm as a relation to mysql. Well actually this is the result of my learning, considering that typescript has almost the same habits as golang :u. But this isn't really neat, maybe I will continue to update it so that the source code feels neat.

Anyway, this project still uses the restful api plan, maybe I'll study tRPC and gRPC, for the database schema there isn't any because I didn't make it :U
